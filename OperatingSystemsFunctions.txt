Operating Systems Functions

The first function of an operating system I'd like to talk about is security.
Today, there are more and more reports of cyber & identity theft.
My operateing system requires a very unigue password that only I know.
This function helps protect me when I'm on the internet.

The next function I'd like to talk about is manipulation of file systems.
I like to play video games and having the files on my hard drive make it smoother to play.
My operating system decides and manages how the game's files should be manipulated and stored.
